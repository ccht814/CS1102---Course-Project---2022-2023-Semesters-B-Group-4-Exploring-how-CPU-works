          <p>
            Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of any computing device,
            which controls and executes the instructions of a program. In this
            section, we will explore the different types of CPUs and their
            features.

          <p>
            Modern CPU is generally a multi-core processor that contains several independent processing units.  Each independent processing unit(core) would execute multiple threads to complete multiple tasks of the computer at the same time. Parallel processing improves the computer's IO and calculating performance, it greatly performs in demanding applications like gaming, video editing and scientific simulations. Modern CPUs also have larger caches, more advanced instruction sets, and high clock speeds. The modern CPUs also support features like virtualization, hardware-assisted security and power management for better power-efficient and flexibility.

            <p>
              Parallel processing typically means dividing multiple tasks of the computer into smaller sub-tasks and assigning the sub-tasks to different processing units or cores to their threads. It is a technique used by modern CPUs to better improve performance and complete computer tasks simultaneously. A computer task can be divided into several packs and executed by multiple cores, which reduces time and boost performance. And there are several types of parallel processing techniques, including:
              <br /><br />
              1. Task parallelism: Multiple tasks are executed simultaneously on
              different cores, with each core performing a different part of the
              task. <br /><br>
              2. Data parallelism: The same task is executed on different sets
              of data simultaneously, with each core processing a different set
              of data.<br /><br>
              3. Pipeline parallelism: The different stages of a task are
              executed in parallel on different cores, with each core handling a
              different stage of the task.<br /><br />
              Parallel processing can be applied in many applications and scenes. Including scientific simulations, video and image processing, data analytics or computer IOs, it is better used in processing amounts of datasets. Not all tasks are suitable for parallel processing, different parallelization algorithm and the nature of the tasks would greatly influence the performance of the technique.
