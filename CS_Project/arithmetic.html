          <p>
            The CPU is the brain of a computer, and it is responsible for carrying out all of the calculations and instructions that make the computer function. The CPU has two significant parts of units, including control unit (CU) and arithmetic-logic unit (ALU).

              The arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) performs a variety of computational tasks, including calculations, comparisons, and decisions.<br /><br />
              The arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) performs a variety of computational tasks, including calculations, comparisons, and decisions.The ALU is a fundamental component of a CPU that run binary data with arithmetic and logical operations<br><br>
              ALU is usually formed by registers, logic gates and control circuits. The register stores data being used for the operation, and logic gates are for the actual arithmetic and logical operation.<br /><br />
              ALU is a critical component of a CPU, the overall performance of the whole CPU greatly relies on the performance of its ALU. Modern CPUs generally have optimized ALUs that can effectively handle arithmetic and logical operations and perform well in complex computations and data-intensive tasks.<br /><br>
              The addition is one of the most common operations of ALU, it takes 2 binary numbers as input and produces a sum as output. The whole operation involves bitwise addition, carry propagation and overflow detection. For better understanding, please go to the control page and check the logic gate part, the 4-bit-adder is an example:

          In computer language, there are several boolean operators, the meaning is listed below:

            <p>The following picture is an operation of a 4-bit-ALU. It has 3 inputs and expected the 3 inputs combinations can have 8 possible results in total. The pictures show how ALU operate the basic arithmetic operations and the logic operations. It also takes code to complete the whole settings, but that is not what we want to show here, so just take the picture as a reference: </p>
